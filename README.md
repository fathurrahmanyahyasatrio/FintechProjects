Scheme of the project: 
Part 1: We will thoroughly examine the business challenge and dedicate significant effort to analyze and preprocess the dataset.
Part 2: We will construct the machine learning model, assess the performance, and gain insights into model decisions using interpretability techniques

# Introduction

The issue at hand is related to the lending process, where creditworthiness is assessed. Credit analysis evaluating the likelihood of an applicant repaying a loan promptly or facing default. There are two important concerns:
1. The potential loss of business revenue due to either rejecting qualified candidates or approving too few of them.
2. The financial loss incurred by approving applicants who ultimately fail to repay their loans.

As the number of loan applications reviewed by loan officers increases, these challenges become more complex. Manual approval processes are time-consuming, requiring extensive hours for each application. However, the company continually seeks way to optimize costs and enhance human productivity. This pursuit of efficiency can sometimes lead to human errors and biases since it's impractical to thoroughly assess a large number of applicants while considering all relevant factors.
